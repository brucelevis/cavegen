title: FemDevs' I programming challenge - Cavegen!
---

[En castellano](spanish.md)

This demo features some basic procedural map generation algorithms: 
* Cellular automata, for organic-looking cave-like environments.
* Drunkard walk
* BSP-tree (Binary space partitioning), to generate.

There were many others I would have liked to try, but my availability was somewhat limited. Also, the real stress test
